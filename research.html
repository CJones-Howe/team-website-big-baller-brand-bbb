    <h1>Self-Driving Cars Research</h1>

    <h2>Safety Benefits</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Around 94% of road crashes are caused by human error&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}. By removing the human driver, autonomous vehicles can eliminate mistakes from drunk, distracted, or drowsy driving, dramatically reducing accidents.</li>
      <li>Autonomous systems react faster than humans and consistently maintain safe distances. Advanced driver-assist features (like automatic emergency braking) already help prevent common collisions (e.g. rear-end crashes)&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}, and higher autonomy levels will further improve safety.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Traffic Reduction</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fewer accidents also mean fewer traffic jams caused by collisions. Self-driving cars are programmed to drive smoothly and avoid the stop-and-go waves that lead to congestion&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.</li>
      <li>Platooning (autonomous vehicles driving closely in coordinated groups) can vastly improve highway traffic flow. Research suggests tightly spaced AV platoons could cut congestion-related delays by up to 60% on highways&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Self-driving cars promise greater independence for people with disabilities and older adults. An autonomous vehicle can provide transportation to those who cannot drive, improving their mobility and quality of life&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.</li>
      <li>Ride-sharing fleets of autonomous vehicles could also make transportation more affordable and accessible. By reducing the need for individual car ownership and drivers, AVs can offer convenient mobility at lower cost for non-drivers&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technology Behind Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Self-driving cars utilize a suite of sensors to perceive the environment. Cameras provide visual recognition, radar detects object position and speed, and lidar uses laser scanning to create 3D maps of surroundings&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}. These, along with GPS and detailed maps, help the car know its exact location and road conditions.</li>
      <li>Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication technology enables autonomous cars to "talk" to other vehicles, traffic signals, and infrastructure. This connectivity allows cars to anticipate road conditions and coordinate with traffic systems for smoother and safer journeys&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}.</li>
      <li>The driving decisions are handled by advanced AI software. Machine learning (especially deep neural networks) interprets sensor data to recognize other cars, pedestrians, and hazards, and then decides how to steer, accelerate, or brake accordingly&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}. This AI “driver” continuously learns and improves from experience, making the vehicle smarter over time.</li>
    </ul>
