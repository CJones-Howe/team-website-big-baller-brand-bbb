      <li>Self-driving cars (also known as <em>autonomous vehicles</em>) are vehicles that can navigate and drive without human input, using advanced software and sensors.</li>
      <li>There are six levels of driving automation defined by industry standards, from Level 0 (fully manual) to Level 5 (fully autonomous with no human intervention)&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.</li>
      <li>These cars rely on sensors (cameras, radar, lidar) and AI algorithms to perceive their surroundings and make driving decisions in real time&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.</li>
      <li>Key potential benefits include increased road safety, reduced traffic congestion, and improved mobility for people who cannot drive&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.</li>
